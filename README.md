Public PowerShell Scripts Written by JorgTheElder.

This is simply a collection of PowerShell scripts I have written for my own use, but that are generic enough that I am willing to share them.

##GetLastLogin.ps1
This is a simple script that uses the ActiveDirectory moduse from PS2 or PS3 to find the LastLogon time for any computer or user in the current AD forest.
